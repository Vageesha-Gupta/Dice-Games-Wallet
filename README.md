# Dice Games- Wallet

## Description 
The Dice Games is an engaging app for simulating rolls of a six-sided die while tracking various gameplay metrics. As users roll the die, their balance is dynamically updated based on the results. Rolling a six awards 5 coins, and consecutive sixes provide an additional bonus of 10 coins. Conversely, rolling the same non-six number twice in a row results in a deduction of 5 coins. The app also monitors and displays important statistics, including the total number of dice rolls, the frequency of rolling a six, and the value of the previous roll. Users receive immediate feedback through a congratulatory toast whenever a six is rolled. The app is designed to accommodate both portrait and landscape orientations, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface across different device orientations.
